<h2>About Me</h2>
<p><img class ="pic" src="images/pfp.jpg" /></p>
  <p>Hello! My name is Rachel Purganan and I am currently working towards my certificate in Application Development and Testing at Seattle Central College through a program called Year Up.</p>
  <p>I will be starting a 6-month long internship at the end of March with Providence Health & Services as a Data Scientist intern! As of right now, my current work background consists of customer service experiences, so I am really hoping that this internship role whille allow me to apply both my soft skills that Iâ€™ve built up and my coding skills from this program, which will offers plenty of opportunities for me to grow.</p>
  <p>In the future, my goal is to become a data engineer. I may still have a long way to go, but I won't let that stop me from pursuing a career in the tech field. I am always open to collaborations and opportunities, so I would love to connect with you through LinkedIn!</p>
